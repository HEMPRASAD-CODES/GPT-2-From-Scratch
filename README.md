# GPT-2-From-Scratch

This project provides a comprehensive exploration of the GPT-2 architecture, including implementation details, model components, and key concepts. The notebook is designed for researchers and developers interested in understanding, modifying, or deploying GPT-2 and similar transformer-based language models.

Features

Step-by-step breakdown of the GPT-2 model architecture

Annotated code cells for each major component (embedding, attention, transformer blocks, output)

Explanations aligned with research documentation standards

Suitable for further customization, experimentation, and local deployment

Project Structure

gpt-2-architecture-1.ipynb: Main Jupyter notebook containing code, explanations, and visualizations

Requirements

Python 3.8+

PyTorch or TensorFlow (as per notebook instructions)

Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

[Optional] Ollama, LiteLLM, or Llama C++ for local model deployment

Familiarity with basic deep learning and transformer concepts

Getting Started

Clone this repository or download the notebook file.

Install the required dependencies.

Open gpt-2-architecture-1.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Follow the notebook cells and run them in order for a guided exploration of GPT-2.

Customization and Local Deployment

The notebook is structured to facilitate experimentation with custom datasets and model modifications.

For local deployment or integration with custom containers, refer to the sections on Ollama, LiteLLM, and Llama C++
